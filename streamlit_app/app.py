st.markdown("""
This interactive dashboard explores a synthetic auto insurance dataset to identify **claim risk patterns**, evaluate **customer segments**, and support **fraud mitigation strategies** using a custom **risk scoring system** developed in SQL.

### **App Structure**
Use the sidebar to explore the following sections:
- **Overview** – Portfolio-wide metrics and exploratory visualizations
- **Risk Scoring** – SQL logic behind score construction and flag analysis
- **Segment Explorer** – Filter and analyze customer subgroups
- **Dashboard Summary** – Risk band performance, distributions, and business insights
                        
---

### **Project Objectives**
- Build SQL views and queries to identify high-risk customers based on behavior and demographics
- Profile claim patterns across income, age, vehicle, and location segments
- Design a transparent scoring system for explainable risk analysis
- Visualize key trends to support business recommendations

---

### **Key Findings**
- **Young drivers** and **customers with low credit** are disproportionately represented in high-risk claims
- Risk scores between **3–5** correlate with over **3× the claim rate** of lower scores
- Certain **postal codes and vehicle types** exhibit elevated exposure and claim frequency
- **Credit score** and **driving history** are highly predictive when combined

---

### **Business Recommendations**
- Introduce **tiered pricing or underwriting rules** for customers with risk scores ≥ 3
- Prioritize **manual review** of high-score customers with recent claims
- Consider **credit improvement incentives** to reduce long-term claim risk
- Use regional data to inform **local fraud detection efforts**
